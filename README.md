# Project-CFG
Final Website
Girls - we have our index page, as our home page, and then four other pages, named after popular wines - 
sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot noir and bordeaux. 
If we use one of those pages (say sauvignon blanc) and create that, and then we can use all the same code 
for the other three - all we'll really have to do is change the copy, which is easy.
